# CI orchestration for the update. Keeps generated results off the code branch and runs the
# processing inside the published container via datalad-containers.
#
#   - `main`        holds only the code (this checkout).
#   - `derivatives` is a persistent DataLad dataset on its own branch, cloned standalone
#                   into scratch. The processing is recorded there with
#                   `datalad containers-run`, so every update carries full provenance (the
#                   command, the input subdataset commit, the output diff, and the container
#                   image digest) and history is retained.
#   - `dist`        is the lightweight, force-recreated publication artifact consumed by
#                   downstream users (see README.md).
#
# The published image is used purely as the runtime environment: the code and the dataset
# are bind-mounted in (the image holds no code), and only the image digest is stored in the
# dataset (a small text file), so it stays annex-free and ghcr holds the bytes.
#
# code/update.py and code/compress.py are the actual code and run in any environment; this
# script is only the CI orchestration around them.
#
# Required environment variables:
#   REPO_URL    Authenticated https remote for this repository (clone/push).
#   WORKSPACE   Path to the `main` checkout that holds the code (this repository).
#   IMAGE       Container image reference to run the processing in.
# Optional:
#   TESTING      Set to "true" to run update.py in testing mode: it processes only a few
#                items and reads/writes derivatives/testing.jsonl, leaving the real cache
#                untouched. Empty/unset means a complete run.
#   GITHUB_SHA   Recorded in the provenance message to link results to the code commit.
#   RUNNER_TEMP  Scratch directory for the working clones (default: /tmp).
